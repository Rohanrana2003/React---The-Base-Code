NPM is known as package manager and it does not have any full form like 'node package manager'.

Our React project is based on several external packages which are located in Node Modules are manages by 'NPM'.

'Bundlers' ignites our app, they bind all the files and make our app production ready. There are many type of bundlers like webpack, vite, parscal. We are using parscal.

There are 2 type of dependencies 
    1. Normal dependencies (npm install ....)
    2. Dev dependencies (npm install -D ....) (used for development of app)

'package.json' keeps the track of what version of packages are installed and can be edited.
'package-lock.json' keeps the trach the dependencies are installed correctly in all environments and it can not be edited. 

'Node_modules' is like a database that contain all the data of dependencies. 

If we have 'package.json' and 'package-lock.json' we can re create all our 'node_modules'.

'NPM' is used for installing a package, while 'NPX' is used for executing a package.
